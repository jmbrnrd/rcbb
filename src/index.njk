        <h3>Joining the band</h3>
        <p>The Redstone Big Band is a community band we are open to anyone who plays a traditional big band
           instrument (sax, trumpet, trombone, guitar, bass, keys & drums) and can read music at about grade 5 level, or
            above. No previous jazz experience is necessary, and there are no auditions.</p>
        <p>However, whilst we don't limit our sections to traditional big band numbers (we currently have 10 alto sax
            players, for example!), we are constrained by our rehearsal space and concert logistics.</p>
        <p>Email us with your details (instrument/experience etc.) to {{ config.email.enquiries | urlize | safe }} and we'll let you know whether we currently have
            places available. If we can't offer you a place immediately, then you may be able to 'dep' at rehearsals
            or just come along and watch.
