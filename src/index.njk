        <h2>Joining us</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
        <p>Redstone is a community big band and as such we are open to anyone that plays a traditional big band
           instrument (sax, trumpet, trombone, guitar, bass, keys & drums) and can read music at grade 6 level, or
            above. No previous jazz experience is necessary and there are no auditions.</p>
        <p>However, although we don't limit our sections to traditional big band numbers (we currently have 10 alto sax
            players for example!), we are constrained by our rehearsal space and concert logistics.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in becoming a member then send us an email.</p>
